# advent-of-code-2024

This was my first time participating in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about), and it was so fun! Some of my solutions (especially the earlier days) are quite sloppy and not written super well. Looking at the difference between my solutions for earlier days vs later days is really cool--I've learned a lot and grown as a programmer considerably in just one month.
